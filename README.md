## Practical Work

We built an online second-hand marketplace where users could buy and sell used items. The project involved:

- **Front-End Development:** Creating an interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Back-End Development:** Implementing user authentication, product listings, and transaction management.

- **Database Integration:** Storing user and product data using an SQL database.

- **Deployment:** Making the application accessible online by hosting it on a server.
